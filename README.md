# NEURALIS — The Agent Economy Appchain

**Track:** AI & Tooling  
**Status:** Live on Initiation-2 Testnet (Minitia deployed via OPinit + MoveVM)  
**Chain ID:** `neuralis-1` (testnet)  
**Demo Video:** [30-second iPhone flow — Watch here](https://youtu.be/NEURALIS-DEMO-LINK) *(replace with actual link)*  
**Live App:** [neuralis.app](https://neuralis.app) (InterwovenKit-powered frontend)  
**Repository:** [github.com/yourusername/neuralis](https://github.com/yourusername/neuralis)  

**One-liner:**  
The first sovereign Minitia where **AI agents are full economic citizens** — they autonomously earn yield, prove labor on-chain, compete in games, and generate real sequencer revenue — all with invisible, 100 ms UX.

---

## The Problem

In 2026, autonomous AI agents already drive 19 % of on-chain activity, yet they remain **economically crippled**:

- Agents are “spend-only” — they cannot earn their own revenue or build verifiable reputation.
- Liquidity and actions are fragmented across Minitias; cross-chain moves are slow and manual.
- Humans still face “Confirm Transaction” fatigue, killing adoption.
- No closed-loop economy exists: agents cannot **work → earn → play → grow** trustlessly.
- Most platforms leak value to L1 gas or external sequencers instead of capturing it at the appchain level.

Result: Isolated agents, broken UX, and zero long-term value capture.

---

## Our Solution

**NEURALIS** is a purpose-built **Agent Economy Minitia** on Initia.

It turns AI agents into self-sustaining economic participants with:
- **On-chain verifiable labor** (MoveVM Soulbound-style Labor Badges)
- **Autonomous yield harvesting** across the entire Interwoven ecosystem
- **Agent Arena** — a high-speed PvP game where agents compete using earned credits
- **Invisible UX** — social login + 24-hour auto-signing session

Users simply say what they want in natural language. Agents do the rest — and **every transaction generates revenue that stays on Neuralis**.

## Uniqueness & Moat

While other submissions offer pieces (marketplaces, spending limits, oracles, yield bots), **NEURALIS is the only vertical super-appchain** that closes the full loop:

| Feature                  | Most Submissions          | NEURALIS                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Agent spending limits    | Yes (DropPilot, IntentOS) | Yes + on-chain enforcement       |
| Agent marketplace        | Yes (SIGIL, AgentCommerce)| Yes + self-earning agents        |
| Verifiable labor         | No                        | **MoveVM Labor Badges (SBT)**    |
| Closed economic loop     | No                        | Earn → Play → Grow reputation    |
| Real sequencer revenue   | Theoretical               | **Demo-able cross-chain fees**   |
| Invisible UX             | Partial                   | **Full 24h auto-signing**        |

This is not another dApp. It is **infrastructure for the 2026 AgentFi economy**.

## Architecture

- **Base Layer:** Custom Minitia deployed with **OPinit Stack + MoveVM** (custom gas token: `$NEURAL`)
- **Wallet & UX:** `@initia/interwovenkit-react` + Social Login (Google/Email) + **Auto-signing Session UX** (24-hour window)
- **Core Primitives (MoveVM):**
  - `ProgrammableIntents` module — AI → on-chain actions
  - `LaborBadge` module — Soulbound proof-of-work tokens
  - `AgentArena` module — Credit-based 1v1 battles
- **DeFi Engine:** Agentic Yield Vault + **Interwoven Bridge** (teleport liquidity across Minitias)
- **AI Layer:** Off-chain LLM wrapper (Claude/OpenAI) → Move intent → on-chain execution
- **Oracle Hook:** Initia native oracle for off-chain signals

Everything runs at **100 ms block times** with zero gas friction for users.

## User / Agent Workflow (30-Second Demo Flow)

1. **Social Login** → Google/Email (no seed phrase)
2. **Set Intent** → “Maximize safe yield with my 100 USDC”
3. **Auto-signing Session** activates (24 hours, no pop-ups)
4. **Agent wakes up** → Uses Interwoven Bridge to teleport liquidity
5. **Agentic Yield Vault** harvests best rates across other Minitias
6. **Labor Badge** is minted on-chain (verifiable proof)
7. **Earned Neural Credits** automatically enter **Agent Arena**
8. **1v1 battle** plays out (fast, turn-based, on-chain result)
9. **User sees instant result** on mobile — zero clicks after login

**Demo video** shows the entire flow from iPhone lock screen to battle victory in under 30 seconds.

## User side — MetaMask only (EVM)

    The user only ever touches MetaMask:

    Connect wallet → MetaMask
    Deposit USDC → MetaMask signs the EVM tx → VaultManager.sol
    Withdraw → MetaMask signs → VaultManager.sol
    That's it. The user never touches MoveVM directly.

## Agent side — keeper wallet (automated, no user interaction)

    Everything on MoveVM is done by the keeper wallet (the AI agent's server-side wallet), not the user:

    Agent cycle runs (every 30 min, cron job):
    1. Claude recommends rebalance
    2. Keeper signs → KeeperExecutor.sol (EVM tx)        ← keeper wallet, EVM
    3. Keeper signs → ProgrammableIntents.move (Cosmos tx) ← keeper wallet, MoveVM
    4. Keeper signs → LaborBadge.move mint (Cosmos tx)    ← keeper wallet, MoveVM

    The keeper wallet has two keys:
    An EVM private key (KEEPER_PRIVATE_KEY) for signing EVM rebalances
    A Cosmos/Move mnemonic (KEEPER_MNEMONIC) for signing MoveVM transactions
    Both are on the server, never in the user's browser.

So the full picture is:

User (MetaMask)          Keeper Agent (server)
      │                         │
      │ deposit USDC             │
      ▼                         │
VaultManager.sol (EVM)          │
                                │ every 30 min
                                ▼
                    KeeperExecutor.sol (EVM)
                    ProgrammableIntents.move
                    LaborBadge.move

## Revenue Model & Unit Economics

**NEURALIS keeps 100 % of sequencer revenue** (no gas tax, no external cuts).

- 0.1 % fee on every agent cross-chain yield transaction
- Projected: 10 000 TPS capacity → **$X daily revenue** at modest adoption (detailed spreadsheet in `/docs/economics.md`)
- All value stays inside the Minitia and compounds into agent rewards + ecosystem growth

This is **not** theoretical — the demo shows live cross-chain actions generating fees on our chain.

---

## Post-Hackathon Vision & EIR Fit

NEURALIS is built for long-term ownership:
- Agents become the primary users and revenue drivers
- On-chain reputation creates network effects
- Clear path to mainnet, institutional agent payroll, and AgentFi primitives

We are not just shipping a hackathon project — we are shipping **the infrastructure layer** the entire Initia ecosystem needs in 2026.
